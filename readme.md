Pomodoro is Pomodoro timer for better productivity.
This was made as part of the weekly programming challenge hosted by [DevJam].
The project was made for learning purposes.

## About the project
####üõ† Difficulty Level: Beginner
üìÖ Start: November 12th<br>
üìÖ Deadline: November 18th 16:00 (4PM) GMT

####üìù Project Description
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks - 5 minutes.

üìëUser Stories
- [x] User can see a timer for 25 minutes - the working session
- [x] After the working session is over, the User can see a timer for 5 minutes - the break session
- [x] User can start / pause, stop and reset the timers

üåü Bonus features (optional)
- [x] User can hear a sound playing when the timer hits 00:00 - denoting that the session has ended
- [ ] User can change / customize the minutes in both sessions before starting
- [ ] User can set a long break session of 10 minutes. This will be activated every 4th break session
- [ ] Users can see active pomodoro sessions of other users
- [ ] Users can share their pomodoro sessions with other users to do joint sessions
